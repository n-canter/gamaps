# Guide Tree Optimization with Genetic Algorithm to Improve Multiple Alignment of Protein 3D-structures

Bioinformatic analysis of protein superfamilies is shifting from sequence alignments towards more content-rich 3D-alignments, thus taking advantage of the growing availability of 3D-data.
This raises the need for new ways to improve the accuracy of 3D-superimposition.

We propose a guide tree optimization by genetic algorithm (GA) as a mean to improve the quality of multiple alignment of protein 3D-structures.
As a proof of concept, the GA-based approach was implemented in popular [Matt](http://matt.cs.tufts.edu/) and [Caretta](http://www.bioinformatics.nl/caretta/) algorithms leading to improvement of the TM-score on both [SABmark](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/7/1267/268759) and [Homstrad](https://mizuguchilab.org/homstrad/) datasets.
The best improvement of [TM-score](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/TM-score/#:~:text=The%20TM%2Dscore%20program%20is,whose%20sequences%20can%20be%20different.) was observed in alignments of distant homologues.
